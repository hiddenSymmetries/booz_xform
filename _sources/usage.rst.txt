Overview
--------

From the :doc:`theory` section, we see that the input quantities to
the transformation are the following. To compute :math:`\nu` (the
difference between the old and new toroidal angle) we need
:math:`\iota`, :math:`\lambda`, :math:`B_{\theta_0}`, and
:math:`B_{\zeta_0}`. Also we need any scalars that we wish to
transform from the old coordinates to the new ones, typically
:math:`R`, :math:`Z`, and :math:`B`.  All of these quantities must be
supplied on each magnetic surface for which we want to execute the
transformation.

A common situation is that these input quantities are known on many
magnetic surfaces, but we only wish to execute the transformation on a
subset of the surfaces.  For this reason, there are two radial grids
in ``booz_xform``. First, there is a grid for input quantities, with
:cpp:var:`~booz_xform::Booz_xform::ns_in` surfaces, for which the
normalized toroidal flux has values
:cpp:var:`~booz_xform::Booz_xform::s_in`.  Second, there is a generally
different grid for output quantities, with
:cpp:var:`~booz_xform::Booz_xform::ns_b` surfaces.  The 0-based
indices of the input radial grid on which the transformation will be
executed is determined by
:cpp:var:`~booz_xform::Booz_xform::compute_surfs`, a vector of
integers.  If any radial interpolation of the input data needs to be
done, it should be done before setting the input data on the
:cpp:var:`~booz_xform::Booz_xform::ns_in` grid; no radial
interpolation is performed during the transformation itself.  For
input from a VMEC ``wout`` file, radial interpolation from full-grid
quantities to the half-grid is automatically performed by the
:cpp:func:`~booz_xform::Booz_xform::read_wout` or
:cpp:func:`~booz_xform::Booz_xform::init_from_vmec` functions when
they set the input arrays.

For the input and output quantities that vary on a flux surface, the
dependence on the poloidal and toroidal angles is represented using a
double Fourier series.  There are three different Fourier resolutions
used in the code.  The input data for :math:`R`, :math:`Z`, and
:math:`\lambda` use poloidal mode numbers
:cpp:var:`~booz_xform::Booz_xform::xm` and toroidal mode numbers
:cpp:var:`~booz_xform::Booz_xform::xn`, with a total of
:cpp:var:`~booz_xform::Booz_xform::mnmax` modes.  The input data for
:math:`B_{\theta_0}`, :math:`B_{\zeta_0}`, and :math:`B` use poloidal
mode numbers :cpp:var:`~booz_xform::Booz_xform::xm_nyq` and toroidal
mode numbers :cpp:var:`~booz_xform::Booz_xform::xn_nyq`, with a total
of :cpp:var:`~booz_xform::Booz_xform::mnmax_nyq` modes.  These two
resolutions could be the same, but they are allowed to be different in
case some quantities are known with different resolution than the others,
as is the case in VMEC. Finally, output quantities (functions of the Boozer angles)
are computed using
poloidal mode numbers
:cpp:var:`~booz_xform::Booz_xform::xm_b` and toroidal mode numbers
:cpp:var:`~booz_xform::Booz_xform::xn_b`, with a total of
:cpp:var:`~booz_xform::Booz_xform::mnmax_b` modes.
This third Fourier resolution is controlled by specifying the maximum poloidal mode number
:cpp:var:`~booz_xform::Booz_xform::mpol_b` and the maximum toroidal mode number
:cpp:var:`~booz_xform::Booz_xform::ntor_b`.
     



Python
------

Here we show how to drive the Boozer coordinate transformation from
python.  A similar demonstration can be found in `Jupyter notebook
form in the
repository. <https://github.com/hiddenSymmetries/booz_xform/blob/main/examples/booz_xform_demo.ipynb>`_

We start by importing the package and creating a ``Booz_xform`` object::

  >>> import booz_xform as bx
  >>> b = bx.Booz_xform()

If desired, we can set the input data directly from python, without a VMEC file::

  >>> b.rmnc = [[1, 0.1], [1.1, 0.2]]

Or, we can load in data from a VMEC ``wout_*.nc`` file::

  >>> b.read_wout("../tests/test_files/wout_li383_1.4m.nc")

We now have access to all the data that was loaded, in the form of numpy arrays::

  >>> b.rmnc
  array([[ 1.47265784e+00,  1.47064413e+00,  1.46876563e+00, ...,
         1.38298775e+00,  1.38106309e+00,  1.37915239e+00],
       [ 9.66386163e-02,  9.39656679e-02,  9.12856961e-02, ...,
         8.39222860e-04, -1.15483564e-03, -3.14856274e-03],
       [ 5.94466624e-03,  5.33733834e-03,  4.72596296e-03, ...,
        -3.90319604e-03, -3.99352196e-03, -4.08841769e-03],
       ...,
       [ 3.82105109e-07,  1.56748891e-06,  4.30513328e-06, ...,
        -4.47161579e-07, -4.73285221e-07, -2.08934612e-07],
       [-3.72242588e-07, -2.86176654e-06, -6.26756380e-06, ...,
        -7.09993720e-06, -4.03495548e-06, -1.29908981e-06],
       [ 7.68276658e-08, -7.96425120e-08,  7.05128633e-08, ...,
        -9.91504287e-06, -6.37379506e-06, -2.21053463e-06]])

We can set the desired Fourier resolution::

  >>> b.mboz = 54
  >>> b.nboz = 32

The transformation to Boozer coordinates will be run on all flux
surfaces by default::

  >>> b.compute_surfs
  array([ 0,  1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  6,  7,  8,  9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16,
       17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33,
       34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47],
      dtype=int32)

If desired, we can select only specific surfaces::

  >>> b.compute_surfs = [0, 1, 2, 23, 47]

Now, run the calculation::

  >>> b.run()
  Initializing with mboz=54, nboz=9
  nu = 218, nv = 38
               OUTBOARD (theta=0)        SURFACE         INBOARD (theta=pi)

(The output can be suppressed by setting ``b.verbose = False``
beforehand.)  All of the output data are now available as numpy
arrays::

  >>> b.bmnc_b
  array([[ 1.54860454e+00,  1.54995067e+00,  1.55126119e+00,

       [ 4.76751287e-04,  2.52763362e-04,  1.02340154e-04,

       [ 4.55391623e-04,  2.91930336e-04,  1.55133171e-04,

       ...,
       [-4.75912238e-16,  1.34267428e-16,  1.03266022e-16,

         1.08711597e-16,  3.86347018e-13]])

The python module includes routines for plotting the results,
as described in detail on the :doc:`plotting` page::

  >>> bx.surfplot(b, js=4)

.. image:: surfplot.png
   :width: 400

For plots vs. radius, the x axis can be either the normalized toroidal
flux :math:`s` or :math:`\sqrt{s}`, and the y axis can be either
linear or logarithmic. The :math:`m=n=0` mode can be included or
excluded.

  >>> bx.symplot(b, log=False, sqrts=True, B0=False)

.. image:: symplot1.png
   :width: 400

If desired, results can be saved to a ``boozmn_*.nc`` NetCDF file::

  >>> b.write_boozmn("boozmn_li383_1.4m.nc")

Results from this new ``booz_xform`` module are identical to the old
fortran77 version to machine precision::

  >>> import numpy as np
  >>> from scipy.io import netcdf_file
  >>> # Load reference data generated by the F77 version
  >>> f = netcdf_file("../tests/test_files/boozmn_li383_1.4m.nc", mmap=False)
  >>> bmnc_b_old = f.variables["bmnc_b"][()].transpose()
  >>> print("Difference between fortran and C++/python:", np.max(np.abs(bmnc_b_old - b.bmnc_b)))
  Difference between fortran and C++/python: 1.021405182655144e-14

  
C++
---

For an example of driving the Boozer coordinate transformation
directly from C++, without any involvement of python, you can see
`driver.cpp in the repository
<https://github.com/hiddenSymmetries/booz_xform/blob/main/src/_booz_xform/driver.cpp>`_.

The first step is to create a ``Booz_xform`` object:

.. code-block:: c++

   booz_xform::Booz_xform b;

All the input data can be read in from a VMEC wout file:

.. code-block:: c++

   b.read_wout("wout_li383_1.4m.nc");

However it is not necessary to use a VMEC file. Instead, the input
data can be set directly. 1D and 2D arrays use the Eigen package, as
discussed in more detail in the :doc:`api`.

.. code-block:: c++

   b.mnmax = 100;
   b.ns_in = 51;
   b.rmnc.resize(b.mnmax, b.ns_in);
   b.rmnc(3, 5) = 0.013;

You may wish to set the resolution, and choose which surfaces on which
to run the transformation.

.. code-block:: c++

   b.mboz = 54;
   b.nboz = 32;
   b.compute_surfs.resize(1);
   b.compute_surfs[0] = 47;

The transformation is run using

.. code-block:: c++

   b.run();

You may wish to save the results to a NetCDF file, though this is not
mandatory:

.. code-block:: c++

   b.write_boozmn("boozmn_li383_1.4m.nc");

All of the output data are also available directly from the member
variables of the class instance:

.. code-block:: c++

   std::cout << "B(0,0): " << b.bmnc_b(0, 0) << std::endl;
